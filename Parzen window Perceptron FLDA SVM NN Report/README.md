Non parametric Machine Learning methods - Parzen, Perceptron, FLDA, SVM, NN


The following classifiers need to be implemented on the respective dataset. 

1. Bayes' classifier on Parzen window method using Gaussian kernel (h to be empirically chosen)
2. Fisher discriminant based classifier
3. Perceptron based classifier
4. Support vector machine based classifier (using linear kernel). (Please go through this link to know more about libsvm library download the library according to your system configurations. There are other tools available for SVM, its not mandatory that you use libsvm, but it is convenient. )
5. Multi-layer feed-forward neural network based classifier


The Datasets are from the previous assignments so use group mappings given during those assignments only.

Classifiers 1,2,3: Image data 
Classifiers 4,5: Speech and OCR data
